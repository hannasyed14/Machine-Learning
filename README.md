## Assignments Overview

###  A1 – Linear Regression with Gradient Descent
- Implements univariate linear regression to model the relationship between study hours and test scores.
- Uses gradient descent to optimize weights and biases.
- Includes predictions and visualizations.
- **Key takeaway**: Understanding cost function minimization and model interpretation.

---

### A2 – Multivariate Linear Regression & Vectorization
- Predicts housing prices based on size, number of bedrooms, and age.
- Introduces feature scaling (Z-score normalization) to speed up convergence.
- Compares non-vectorized and vectorized implementations of gradient descent.
- **Key takeaway**: Vectorization improves performance and stability in large datasets.

### A3 – Logistic Regression for Binary Classification
- Predicts the likelihood of customer purchase using time on website and number of pages visited.
- Implements logistic regression from scratch, including sigmoid function, cost computation, gradient descent, and regularization.
- Evaluates performance using accuracy.
- **Key takeaway**: Logistic regression is ideal for binary outcomes, and regularization prevents overfitting.

### A4 – Neural Network for Handwritten Digit Classification
- Classifies grayscale 20x20 images of handwritten digits (0 or 1).
- Trains a feedforward neural network using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Tests different architectures (25 vs. 100 neurons, ReLU vs. tanh).
- Evaluates performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and precision/recall.
- **Key takeaway**: Simple neural nets can effectively classify binary image data but require tuning for generalization.

### A5 – Deep Learning Regression Model
- Uses a deep neural network to predict prices from synthetic real estate features.
- Includes model training, validation, and evaluation using MAE (mean absolute error).
- Visualizes loss and MAE trends over epochs, and compares predicted vs. actual prices.
- **Key takeaway**: Neural networks can model nonlinear relationships in regression problems effectively with proper architecture and tuning.
